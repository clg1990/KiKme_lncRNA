## How to use this repository

The files of this repository (https://github.com/clg1990/KiKme_lncRNA) are intended to be used in chronological order (1-4). They are built according to the instruction of the WGCNA package (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-559). The mRNA-Seq and lncRNA-Seq data and associated meta data are not publicly available due to data protection regulations of the KiKme-study. All results created using the pipeline will be added with the release of the preprint/accepted manuscript.

1.	Merging and clustering of mRNA- and lncRNA-Seq data, analysis for outliers, creation of trait data
2.	Construction of the WGCNA-network
3.	Correlation of trait data with the gene sets (modules) and adjustment of p-values
4.	Extraction of network-data (adjacency, connectivity, etc.)
